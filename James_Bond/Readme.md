James has just been hired as the movie director for the next James Bond movie and is on a quest to find an actor to play the role of James Bond in the movie. In order to find the perfect candidate, he interviews some candidates and asks each of them to input a list of random numbers. The candidates can list as many numbers as they want. All candidates whose lists contain the numbers 0,0, and 7, in that exact order, are automatically selected for the next round of auditioning. Write a Python program to help James quickly complete this task. The program should output whether or not a candidate is qualified to be James Bond.

> **_NOTE:_** Your code should have at least 3 user-defined functions.
